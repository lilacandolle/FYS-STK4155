===== Plan for week 41 =====


!bblock  Material for the active learning sessions on Tuesday and Wednesday
  * Exercise on writing your own stochastic gradient and gradient descent codes. This exercise continues next week with studies of automatic differentiation
  * One lecture at the beginning of each session on the material from weeks 39 and 40 and how to write your own gradient descent code
  * Discussion of project 2
  * Your task before the sessions: revisit the material from weeks 39 and 40 and in particular the material from week 40 on stochastic gradient descent
